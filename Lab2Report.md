 # **Part 1**
 
 # **Part 2**
 For lab 3, a failure-inducing input for the ReverseInPlace method would be {1,2,3}. Its symptom is {3,2,3}. An input that doesn't induce a failure would be {1}.
 
 
 # **Part 3**
 Something I learned from lab 3 is that you can have inputs that would not produce any errors or failures, but your code would still not completely work for other inputs. This means that I have to thoroughly test my code in order to make sure that any inputs will not break my code.
