# Lab 5 Report

I enjoyed completing the lab report from Week 4. This is where I learned how to use all of those different commands in order to do different things in VS Code, such as the "find" and "grep" function. For each individual command, I was able to use it multiple times for various outcomes. For example, for the "find" command, I was able to use it to find the name of any file that contained the specific input. Another thing I could do with the "find" command was use it to find the files with a size bigger than the size I indicate. Additionally, another command I found to be helpful was the "wc" command. "wc" is used to print out the number of lines, words, and characters in the specified file. I was surprised to see that there wasa function for this, demonstrating how much one can do with these commands. Lastly, I learned about the grep command, something that was useful in the Skill Demo 1. Overall, these commands were interesting for me to learn about, as it revelaed how many things I can do in VS Code, and these commands would prove to be helpful in later assignments.
